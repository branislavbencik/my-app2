    description: "The Basilica of St. George is the finest example of Romanesque architecture remaining in the great city of Prague. The basilica was partially damaged by fire in 1142 and the main apse and twin steeples were added after. Although the facade of the basilica was renovated in the 17th century in the Baroque style, elements of the Romanesque still exist in the interior as well, results of a meticulous restoration between 1887 and 1908. The simple, yet monumental Romanesque interior showcases the architectural style with massive walls, plain columns, the cross vaulting, and half circle arches. The main nave holds the tombs of Premyslid princes.",
